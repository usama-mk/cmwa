## üîò Issue 2: Buttons Not Responding

### Problem

When clicking "Add Project" or "Update Project" buttons, nothing happens.

### ‚úÖ Fixed (Updated)

- **Root Cause**: Poor form validation, error handling, and double-click issues
- **Solution**:
  - Enhanced validation and better error messages
  - Added submission state management to prevent double-clicks
  - Added loading spinners and disabled states during submission
  - Better user feedback with success messages
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Deployed and fixed

### What Was Fixed

1. **Form Validation**:

   - Added proper validation for required fields
   - Added validation for completion percentage (0-100)
   - Added trimming of input values

2. **Error Handling**:

   - Better error messages with specific details
   - Proper error logging
   - Success messages for user feedback

3. **Button States**:
   - Added loading spinners during submission
   - Disabled buttons during processing to prevent double-clicks
   - Better user feedback with success messages
   - Proper state management for form submission

### Example of Fixed Validation:

```typescript
// Before: Basic check
if (!newProject.name || !newProject.clientId) {
  alert("Please select a client and enter a project name");
  return;
}

// After: Comprehensive validation
if (!newProject.name.trim()) {
  alert("Please enter a project name");
  return;
}

if (!newProject.clientId) {
  alert("Please select a client");
  return;
}

if (
  newProject.completion_percentage < 0 ||
  newProject.completion_percentage > 100
) {
  alert("Completion percentage must be between 0 and 100");
  return;
}
```
